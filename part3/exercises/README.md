# Exercises for this part are in another repo

As recommended in part3, the exercises are uploaded in a diferent dedicated git repository.

>New repo: https://github.com/ldsb18/fsopen-part3-notes-backend

In some exercises from this part, it's needed to modify the existing code from exercises in part 2
I wanted to the keep the old files working without a backend so a made a new branch

>New Branch name: phonebookBackend
